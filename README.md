# Cocktail Haven

Cocktail Haven uses [**The Cocktail DB**](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) API to allow users to search for various cocktails and view detailed recipes. The API provides a comprehensive list of cocktails, including ingredients, instructions, and images for each drink.

### Key Features:

- **Search Cocktails**: Users can search for cocktails by name or ingredient.
- **Filter by Category and Ingredient**: Cocktails can be filtered based on categories such as alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks, as well as by specific ingredients.
- **View Recipe Details**: Each cocktail includes a detailed recipe with instructions, measurements, and ingredient images.
- **Save Favorites:** After filtering and finding the perfect drink recipes, users can save them to their favorites for quick access later.

The app interacts with **The Cocktail DB** API through GET requests, returning results based on the user's search criteria and dynamically displaying them.
